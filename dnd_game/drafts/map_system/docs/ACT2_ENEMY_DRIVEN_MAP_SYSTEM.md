# Act 2 Enemy-Driven Map System Draft

## Purpose

This draft extends the Act 1 hybrid map idea into a more complex Act 2 structure without replacing the current playable scaffold.

Act 1 is mostly a hub-and-branch adventure with short local maps. Act 2 should feel more like an expedition theater:

- the player returns to Phandalin as an operational hub
- early routes can be completed in different orders
- delaying a route leaves permanent consequences
- enemy factions change what each map means
- late routes are both required, but order changes stakes
- the final Wave Echo chain becomes a deeper, multi-objective dungeon sequence

The companion blueprint lives in:

- `dnd_game/drafts/map_system/data/act2_enemy_map.py`
- preview command: `python -m dnd_game.drafts.map_system.examples.act2_preview`

## Enemy-First Design

Act 2 should be mapped around enemy pressure packages rather than around location names alone.

| Enemy package | Enemies | Map function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claim_war` | `expedition_reaver`, `cult_lookout`, `gutter_zealot` | turns the public claims war into route sabotage and false map control |
| `cave_predators` | `grimlock_tunneler`, `stirge_swarm`, `ochre_slime`, `acidmaw_burrower`, `carrion_lash_crawler`, `hookclaw_burrower` | makes the mine ecology hostile before the cult is fully visible |
| `pact_haunting` | `animated_armor`, `spectral_foreman`, `graveblade_wight`, `iron_prayer_horror` | shows the old Phandelver Pact defending itself badly or under corrupted orders |
| `quiet_choir` | `cult_lookout`, `choir_adept`, `starblighted_miner`, `choir_executioner`, `obelisk_eye`, `caldra_voss` | turns Act 2 from claim dispute into cosmic listening-horror |
| `black_lake` | `animated_armor`, `starblighted_miner`, `blacklake_pincerling`, `spectral_foreman`, `obelisk_eye` | makes the final threshold a tactical and spiritual crossing |

## Route Shape

The Act 2 overworld is not a simple line. It has three early leads, a forced midpoint, two late branches that affect each other, and a final dungeon chain.

## Local Map Philosophy

Act 2 local maps should usually have five to seven rooms, not the four-room pattern used by many Act 1 sites.

Every local map should include at least two of these:

- one mandatory enemy room
- one optional objective room
- one rescue, clue, or pressure-control room
- one boss or convergence room
- one room that changes if the site was delayed

This keeps the text-based map readable while making Act 2 feel wider and more reactive.

## Draft Site Breakdown

| Site | Enemy basis | Complexity upgrade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Agatha's Circuit` | Quiet Choir defilement, undead omen pressure | social boss room; truth quality depends on whether side branches are resolved |
| `Neverwinter Wood Saboteur Camp` | rival reavers plus Choir lookouts | ranged roost, spoiled stores, proof cache, and fallback trail |
| `Stonehollow Dig Site` | slimes, grimlocks, collapse predators | rescue and route-truth branches; Nim hook; delayed version can add foreman or hookclaw pressure |
| `Phandalin Sabotage Night` | Choir lookout plus adept strike cell | three-front town crisis where the player cannot protect everything first |
| `Broken Prospect Threshold` | Pact armor, spectral foreman, rival scouts | haunted route-control dungeon; stronger if taken after South Adit |
| `South Adit Prison Line` | starblighted miners and Choir wardens | captive survival map; Irielle hook; stronger if taken after Broken Prospect |
| `Wave Echo Outer Galleries` | cave predator ecology | bigger five-column map with side runs, slime lanes, false echoes, and a final haul gate |
| `Black Lake Crossing` | constructs, starblight, lake predators | three objective choices: shrine, barracks, or anchors |
| `Forge Resonance Lens` | Caldra, adepts, obelisk pressure | final boss map where side objectives modify the boss fight |

## Feasible Implementation Steps

1. Data-only draft
   - Add the Act 2 blueprint and design doc without wiring it into the playable game.
   - Use existing `HybridMapBlueprint`, `TravelNode`, `DungeonMap`, and `DungeonRoom` models.
   - This is the safest first step and is now represented by `act2_enemy_map.py`.

2. Add Act 2 map preview
   - Add a standalone preview script like the Act 1 preview.
   - Use a mid-to-late Act 2 state so the map demonstrates more complexity than the opening routes.

3. Generalize map-state naming
   - Rename Act 1-specific methods in `gameplay/map_system.py` behind neutral helpers.
   - Keep `current_scene` as the authority, but allow the active blueprint to be selected by `current_act`.

4. Add richer requirement support
   - Act 2 needs requirements that Act 1 did not need:
     - "any two of these three flags"
     - metric thresholds like `Whisper Pressure >= 4`
     - route-order conditions like `act2_first_late_route == "broken_prospect"`
   - Draft support now exists through `FlagCountRequirement`, `NumericFlagRequirement`, `FlagValueRequirement`, and `DraftMapState.flag_values`.
   - This keeps the map from needing awkward fake flags such as `act2_midpoint_unlocked`.

5. Wire the Act 2 hub to the blueprint
   - Keep the existing Act 2 scene flow intact.
   - Let the map render available routes next to the current hub options.
   - Feed real Act 2 flags and metric values into `DraftMapState` so the blueprint can unlock sabotage night from any two early leads directly.
   - Read-only route rendering now exists through the in-game `map` command; local site maps render as draft previews when the current scene is inside an Act 2 site.

6. Convert one site at a time
   - Start with `Stonehollow Dig`, because it has clear enemies, a companion hook, and a simple rescue outcome.
   - `Stonehollow Dig` is now the first playable Act 2 local map. It uses `act2_map_state`, room navigation, room-specific encounters/events, Nim recruitment, and the original route-control/whisper consequences.
   - Then convert `South Adit`, because it tests order consequences and companion recruitment.
   - Leave `Forge of Spells` for last, because it needs boss-modifier support.

7. Add enemy-pressure overlays
   - Instead of only showing room symbols, expose the enemy package:
     - `claim_war`
     - `cave_predators`
     - `pact_haunting`
     - `quiet_choir`
     - `black_lake`
   - Later, this can influence random encounters and room text.

8. Save and test
   - Add Act 2 map state into saves beside the existing map payload.
   - Test travel availability, delayed lead consequences, late-route order, and final route unlocking.
   - Keep the preview script as a fast visual smoke test.

## Integration Guardrails

- Do not rewrite the Act 2 scaffold all at once.
- Keep the existing scene methods as the story authority.
- Let the map system display, gate, and navigate. Let the scenes keep handling combat, companion recruitment, rewards, and pressure changes.
- Add richer requirement logic before trying to represent all Act 2 consequences in the map data.
- Treat enemy packages as a layer on top of room roles, not as a replacement for authored scene text.

## Best Next Decision

The next practical build step should be either:

1. make the Act 2 blueprint render from the in-game `map` command while staying read-only, or
2. add requirement support for "any two of three flags" and metric thresholds, then wire `Stonehollow Dig` as the first playable Act 2 local map.
